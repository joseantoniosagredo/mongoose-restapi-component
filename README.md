# React component for Mongoose API UI

Simplest admin usage! You can control safely your data with an admin panel.

Usage:
```
import Admin from 'mongoose-restapi-ui-component'


export default (props) => <Admin tree='your/path/to/tree' />

```

Posible props:
- `tree`: The tree path published by [mongoose-restapi-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-restapi-ui)
- `authProvider`: [authProvider](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/docs/Admin.md#authprovider) from react-admin.

Enjoy!
